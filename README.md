# Fake-User-Detection-Using-Flask
🕵️‍♂️ Fake Social Media Profile Detection

A Machine Learning-powered Flask web application that predicts whether a social media profile is Real or Fake based on user-provided input features.

🚀 Overview

This project aims to detect fake user accounts commonly found on online social platforms. Using machine learning techniques and a simple web interface, the system classifies user profiles into:

Real User

Fake User

It uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on a custom dataset (modified_data.csv) and provides prediction results along with key model evaluation metrics.
